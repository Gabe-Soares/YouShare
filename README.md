## 👾 _An end to end Project_
This project was designed as a social network with the purpose of being a portfolio project to the contributors who are designing, documenting, building and deploying this solution.
YouShare is a social network with only the features to post text content, react to content, comment on content and user features in general (create account, change password, authentication using JWT). It's a simple project in it's core, with only a few business rules specified, this way giving us freedom to focus on implementing a complete solution and document from the design to the deploy, working with modern techniques and technologies since the start of the first application.
